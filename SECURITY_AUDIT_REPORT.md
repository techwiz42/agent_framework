   // Add JWT validation and security headers
   export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
     const token = request.cookies.get('auth-token')
     if (!token && isProtectedRoute(request.pathname)) {
       return NextResponse.redirect('/login')
     }
     return NextResponse.next()
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced CSP Directives**
   ```python
   # More restrictive CSP for production
   "Content-Security-Policy": (
       "default-src 'self'; "
       "script-src 'self' 'sha256-...'; "  # Use specific hashes
       "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
       "connect-src 'self' wss: https:; "
   )
   ```

### Medium Priority

3. **Additional Rate Limiting**
   - Implement endpoint-specific rate limits
   - Add progressive rate limiting for repeated offenders
   - Consider implementing CAPTCHA for high-risk endpoints

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Add Prometheus metrics for security events
   - Implement alerting for critical security patterns
   - Consider adding threat intelligence integration

### Low Priority

5. **Security Headers Enhancement**
   - Add `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` header
   - Implement `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header
   - Consider adding `Report-To` directive for CSP violations

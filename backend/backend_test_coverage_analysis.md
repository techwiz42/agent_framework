1. **Main Application** (`main.py`) - 0% coverage - Core application bootstrap untested ❌
2. **Auth API** (`auth.py`) - 38% coverage - Critical security functionality undertested ⚠️
3. **Agent Interface** (`agent_interface.py`) - 0% coverage - Fundamental interface untested ❌
4. **Collaboration Manager** (`collaboration_manager.py`) - 13% coverage - Important feature undertested ⚠️

### **Medium Priority (Financial & Operational):**
1. **Billing Automation** (`billing_automation.py`) - 35% coverage - Financial operations undertested ⚠️

## Memory Management for Unit Test Creation

**Issue**: Claude Code consistently runs out of JavaScript heap memory when creating comprehensive unit tests for multiple files.

**Recommended Strategies**:
1. **Limit scope**: Request tests for 1-3 related files maximum per session
2. **Use Task tool**: Let Claude analyze codebase structure before writing tests
3. **Target specific functionality**: Focus on particular methods or classes rather than entire modules
4. **Work incrementally**: Build test coverage file by file rather than module by module
5. **Reference existing patterns**: Point to existing test files to follow established patterns

**Example requests**:
- ✅ "Create unit tests for app/agents/base_agent.py only"
- ✅ "Use Task tool to analyze and plan unit tests for the agents module"
- ❌ "Create unit tests for all agent files"
- ❌ "Add comprehensive test coverage for the entire services module"

## Recent Test Additions (January 2025)

### Deepgram Service Test Coverage Added
**File**: `tests/unit/test_deepgram_service.py`
**Target**: `app/services/voice/deepgram_service.py`

**Coverage includes**:
- ✅ Language code mapping functionality (`map_language_code_to_deepgram`)
- ✅ Model compatibility logic (`get_compatible_model_for_language`)
- ✅ DeepgramService initialization and availability checks
- ✅ File transcription with success and error scenarios
- ✅ Live transcription session management
- ✅ Audio data handling and WebSocket communication
- ✅ Transcript data processing and formatting
- ✅ Integration scenarios with language mapping and model fallback
- ✅ Singleton instance consistency

**Test Statistics**:
- **Test Classes**: 6 comprehensive test classes
- **Test Methods**: 25+ individual test methods
- **Critical Functionality**: Tests cover all major STT workflows including language auto-detection, model compatibility, and live streaming

**Impact**: This addresses the most critical gap in voice services testing, covering the core STT functionality that powers the application's speech-to-text features.

### Database Layer Test Coverage Added
**File**: `tests/unit/test_database.py`
**Target**: `app/db/database.py`

**Coverage includes**:
- ✅ Database engine configuration and connection pooling
- ✅ AsyncSessionLocal configuration and behavior
- ✅ get_db dependency function with proper session lifecycle
- ✅ get_db_context async context manager
- ✅ Database initialization (init_db) with transaction management
- ✅ Database health checking (check_db_connection) with error handling
- ✅ Database URL configuration from settings/environment/defaults
- ✅ Connection pool scaling for 100+ concurrent users
- ✅ Error recovery and resilience scenarios
- ✅ Concurrent session handling and cleanup

**Test Statistics**:
- **Test Classes**: 8 comprehensive test classes
- **Test Methods**: 30+ individual test methods
- **Critical Functionality**: Tests cover all database operations including connection management, session lifecycle, initialization, and health monitoring

**Impact**: This addresses the most fundamental infrastructure component, ensuring reliable database operations that underpin all application functionality including user management, conversations, and data persistence.

## CRITICAL: Git Commit Policy for Test Code

**⚠️ NEVER COMMIT TEST CODE TO GIT AUTOMATICALLY ⚠️**

- **User explicitly forbids automated git commits of any kind**
- **Tests must be manually reviewed and committed by the user**
- **Claude Code should NEVER run `git add` or `git commit` commands for test files**
- **Always let the user handle their own git operations**
- **Only suggest what changes could be committed, never execute git commit commands**

This policy prevents:
- Accidental commits of incomplete or incorrect test code
- Bypassing code review processes
- Overriding user's git workflow preferences
- Potential conflicts with existing development practices

## CRITICAL: No Mocks in Production Code

**🚫 NEVER ADD MOCK VALUES TO PRODUCTION CODE TO PASS TESTS 🚫**

- **Mock values in production code are a cardinal sin**
- **Mock values cause false reporting and hide real system issues**
- **Always implement real monitoring and stats collection**
- **If real data isn't available, throw an error or return null - don't fake it**
- **Mock values waste debugging time and create false confidence**

**Example of what NOT to do:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Mock values in production code
def get_websocket_connections():
    return 0  # Hardcoded mock value - NEVER DO THIS

# ✅ CORRECT - Real implementation or explicit error
def get_websocket_connections():
    return len(active_connections)  # Real data
    # OR if not available:
    # raise NotImplementedError("WebSocket monitoring not implemented")
```

**Historical example**: The admin page showed 0 WebSocket connections because of hardcoded mock values, which wasted significant debugging time and created false confidence in the system.

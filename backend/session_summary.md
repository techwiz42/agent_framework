# Session Summary - 6/1/2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Agent Message Display
Fixed the issue where agent messages were displayed as user messages in the WebSocket interface. The problem was in `app/api/websockets.py` where agent messages didn't consistently have the correct message type fields:

- Added explicit `sender_type: "agent"` to historical agent messages
- Added `message_type: "agent"` earlier in the message formatting process
- Ensured consistent metadata formatting with both `agent_type` and `message_type` fields
- Updated the agent response broadcast message format for consistency

### 2. Conversations List Not Showing
Fixed the conversations list page not displaying previous conversations. Issues were in `app/api/conversations.py`:

- Corrected the join between Conversation and ConversationUser tables by explicitly specifying the join condition: `Conversation.id == ConversationUser.conversation_id`
- Applied the same fix to the search endpoint
- Improved the conversation response formatting by querying for message and participant counts directly instead of relying on ORM relationships

## Key Files Modified
- `/app/api/websockets.py` - Fixed agent message formatting and type fields
- `/app/api/conversations.py` - Fixed conversation listing and search endpoints

## Current Status
- Agent messages now correctly display with their appropriate styling/type
- Conversation history now properly appears in the conversation list page

## Remaining Work
- Continue addressing issues from CLAUDE.md, particularly around API endpoint implementations and agent processing
- Monitor for any additional issues with conversation display or agent message handling

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (for caching)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and database credentials

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the backend server
python run.py
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with backend URL and other settings

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

#### Backend (.env)
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thanotopolis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

#### Frontend (.env.local)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000
```

## ü§ñ AI Agents

### Core Agents

- **Barney (Demo Answering Service)**: Telephone receptionist for Cyberiad.ai
- **Moderator**: Agent selection and routing
- **Financial Services**: Payment plans and billing
- **Compliance**: Regulatory and documentation
- **Emergency**: Crisis and urgent situations
- **Inventory**: Facilities and equipment management
- **Web Search**: Real-time information retrieval

### Agent Ownership

Agents can be **Free** (available to all) or **Proprietary** (organization-specific):

```python
# Free agent
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    OWNER_DOMAINS = []  # Available to all

# Single organization
class MyProprietaryAgent(BaseAgent):
    OWNER_DOMAINS = ["acme"]  # Only for ACME

# Multi-organization
class MySharedAgent(BaseAgent):
    OWNER_DOMAINS = ["acme", "demo", "partner"]  # Multiple orgs
```

## ‚òéÔ∏è Telephony Features

### Phone Integration
- **Call Forwarding**: Organizations keep existing numbers
- **Real-time Processing**: Live audio streaming with STT/TTS
- **Multi-language**: Automatic language detection and switching
- **Agent Collaboration**: Complex queries routed to specialists
- **Call Analytics**: Duration, costs, transcripts, and recordings

### How It Works
1. Customer calls organization's existing number
2. Call forwards to platform's Twilio number
3. AI agent (like Barney) answers and processes conversation
4. Real-time transcription and response generation
5. Natural voice synthesis back to caller

## üåê API Endpoints

### Core APIs
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication and user management
- `/api/conversations/*` - Chat and message handling
- `/api/agents/*` - Agent discovery and configuration
- `/api/telephony/*` - Phone system integration
